# Part 3
# 
# Create an interactive plot which allows the user to vary the degree of a Lagrange interpolating polynomial (not piecewise) for a certain set of knots and evaluation points. The plot should show the interpolating function and the knots. For demonstration purposes use the function from part 1, i.e. 
# f
# (
# x
# )
# =
# e
# x
# cos
# (
# 10
# x
# )
# 
#  but now plot the interval 
# 
# x
# âˆˆ
# [
# 1
# ,
# 2
# ]
# ,
#  choose a modest number of knots and centre your interpolant (i.e. as the degree increases and more knots are required work from the centre out, as seen in the video).
